PP IN JJ JJ '' ADVP	One was Eleanor Roosevelt, whose heroic labor activism helped lead the fight against slavery in the 18th and 19th centuries.1 Roosevelt's life and work reveal a society that was racially hostile toward race or color though not to everyone, especially not and by no means all.2 In certain respects, organizations such as National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) became a part of the structure of the New Deal-era counter-theory of racial segregation and "slave concentration".3 In 1935, one of the two co-founders of NORML, Jack Anderson, published an essay in his book "Beyond the Two Thousand Year Old Practice of Slavery", arguing that 'there was no moral basis for punishing blacks' based on their race as 'an instrument for the destruction of any race'.4 The concept of race is problematic, as it supposedly denied that some people share the same distinctive characteristics with other racial groups.5 Nonetheless, he argued: 'possessing racial characteristics, feelings or acts in conjunction with shared common characteristics of this race is not an example of race discrimination in the sense required under 1983.
