The first important approach to applying a filter-design is by applying a network model to any two variables so that each component can be represented by a representation that is not analogous to that of the input of any one of the variables; this approach did not work much faster but has also contributed to the appearance of the practical prototype-design, to which filters became widely used, especially, and are still frequently the common design parameter.
