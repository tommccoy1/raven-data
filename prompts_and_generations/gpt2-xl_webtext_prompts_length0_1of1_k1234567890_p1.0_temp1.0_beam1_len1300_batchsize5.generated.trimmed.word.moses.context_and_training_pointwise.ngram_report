Ratings are expressed as a percent . &NEWLINE; &NEWLINE; Fast Affiliate Ratings : These first national ratings are available at approximately 11 a.m. ET the day after telecast . The figures may include stations that did not air the entire network feed , as well as local news breaks or cutaways for local coverage or other programming . Fast Affiliate ratings are not as useful for live programs and are likely to differ significantly from the final results , because the data reflect normal broadcast feed patterns . &NEWLINE; &NEWLINE; Share ( of Audience ) : The percent of households ( or persons ) using television who are tuned to a specific program , station or network in a specific area at a specific time . &NEWLINE; &NEWLINE; Time Shifted Viewing : Program ratings for national sources are produced in three streams of data – Live , Live + Same-Day and Live + 7 Day . Time-shifted figures account for incremental viewing that takes place with DVRs . Live + SD includes viewing during the same broadcast day as the original telecast , with a cut-off of 3 a.m. local time when meters transmit daily viewing to Nielsen for processing . Live + 7 ratings include viewing that takes place during the 7 days following a telecast . &NEWLINE; &NEWLINE; Source : The Nielsen Company . &NEWLINE;*** &NEWLINE; &NEWLINE; Program ratings for national sources are produced in
